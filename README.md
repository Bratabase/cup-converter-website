# Cup converter website

This is a sample site that allows you to convert bra sizes between brands using
the [Bratabase API](http://developers.bratabase.com/).

This demo uses the [Bratabase JS API](https://github.com/Bratabase/bratabase-js)
client on the browser to perform the comparisons.

It accesses the [sizing compare API](http://developers.bratabase.com/brand-sizing-compare/)
 to construct the side by side tables for the selected brands just like the
  brand compare feature on [Bratabase.com](http://www.bratabase.com/).
